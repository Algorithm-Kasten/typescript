# Doubly Linked List

A **doubly linked list** is a linear collection of data elements in which the order of the element is determined not by its physical address in the memory, but by references (or links) that each element points to.

The structure of the element or a node in a doubly linked list consists of a data and two references: _previous_ and _next_. Having two references for _previous_ and _next_ allows for simpler insertion and removal of elements in any position in the list. Also, we can easily traverse the list in reverse order using the `previous`.

A drawback of doubly linked list is that it consumes more memory because of the extra information in the node.

## Pseudocode

### prepend

```text
prepend(head, tail, value) -> void
    Pre: head is the 1st node in the list
         tail is the last node in the list
         value is the value we're going to insert
    Post: a new node has been inserted at the head of the list

    n = Node(value)

    IF (head == NULL)
        head = n
        tail = n
    ELSE
        n.next    = head
        head.prev = n
        head      = n
    END IF
END prepend
```

### append

```text
append(head, tail, value) -> void
    Pre: head is the 1st node in the list
         tail is the last node in the list
         value is the value we're going to insert in the list
    Post: a new node has been inserted at the end of the list

    n = Node(value)

    IF (tail == NULL)
        tail = n
        head = n
    ELSE
        n.prev    = tail
        tail.next = n
        tail 　　　= n
    END IF
END append
```

### deleteHead

```text
deleteHead(head, tail, del) -> Node
    Pre: head is the first node in the list
         tail is the last node in the list
         del stores a node to be deleted
    Post: head has been replaced

    del = NULL

    IF (head == tail)
        del  = head
        head = NULL
        tail = NULL
    ELSE IF (head != NULL)
        del       = head
        head      = head.next
        head.prev = NULL
    END IF

    return del
END
```

### deleteTail

```text
deleteTail(head, tail, del) -> Node
    Pre: head is the first node in the list
         tail is the last node in the list
         del stores a node to be deleted
    Post: tail has been replaced

    del = NULL

    IF (tail == head)
        del  = tail
        head = NULL
        tail = NULL
    ELSE IF (tail != NULL)
        del       = head
        tail      = tail.prev
        tail.next = NULL
    END IF

    return del
END
```

### delete

```text
delete(head, tail, value) -> Node | NULL
    Pre: head is the 1st node in the list
         tail is the last node in the list
         value is the value we're going to remove from the list
    Post: a node is removed from the list and returned; otherwise, return NULL

    // FIND returns the node with a given value or NULL
    deletedNode = find(value)

    IF (deletedNode)
        IF (deletedNode.prev && deletedNode.next)
            deletedNode.prev.next = deletedNode.next;
            deletedNode.next.prev = deletedNode.prev;
            return deletedNode;
        ELSE IF (deletedNode == head && deletedNode == tail)
            head = NULL
            tail = NULL
        ELSE IF (deletedNode == head)
            head       = head.next
            head?.prev = NULL
        ELSE IF (deletedNode == tail)
            tail       = tail.prev
            tail?.next = NULL
        END IF
    END IF

    return deletedNode
END delete
```

### Reverse Traversal

```text
reverseTraversal(tail)
    Pre: tail points to the last node in the list
    Post: a list has been traversed in reverse order

    n = tail
    WHILE (n != NULL)
        print n.value
        n = n.prev
    END WHILE
END reverseTraversal
```
